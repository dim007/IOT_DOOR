# IOT_DOOR
Bluetooth/RFID enabled door to remotely lock and unlock a mechanical deadbolt.
Version 2:
Upgraded to external power source.
Bluetooth module for remote control via Rasp Pi.
New bevel gear design reduces wait time when engaging lock.
Piezo buzzer notifies user on: key accepted, door lock/unlock.
LED indicator specifies statues of the door.

Supplies: Arduino, Ywrobot MB102 Power Supply, 28BYJ-48 Motor, Analog Button, RFIO-RC522 module, LED, Piezo passive buzzer, HC-08 Bluetooth 4.0 module, 10 kOhm resistor, jumpers, glue gun, two 55x165mm breadboards

Version 1:
Small project with the aim of remotely locking/unlocking my front door.
The 3D objects include a hardware mount for the Arduino and Motor and one pair of gears to turn the deadbolt. The device uses an RFID reader to allow entry to user from the outside, and a push button to lock/unlock from the inside. Project is battery powered with two 9v batteries.

Supplies: Arduino, 28BYJ-48 Motor, push button, RFIO-RC522 module, 10 kOhm resistor, jumpers, glue gun, two 9v batteries, two 9v to DC Jacks.
